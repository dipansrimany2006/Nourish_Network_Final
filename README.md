Welcome to our solution for the GDSC Solution Challenge 2024.
Our solution aims for a Hunger-Free World.


First, all the HTML files are in the main file, CSS files in the CSS folder, Javascript files in the Javascript folder, and pictures and videos in the asset folder inside the CSS file.

Only a video of 255 MB needs to be downloaded
Click the link (https://we.tl/t-s4J2LKRyO2) and put the video in the videos folder if you clone the repository.
In case the link doesn't work, follow the steps written in the text file in the "videos" folder :(https://github.com/dipansrimany2006/Nourish_Network_Final/blob/main/css/assets/videos/Video_link.txt)
